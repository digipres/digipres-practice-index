Archiving these dynamic websites requires a different approach, including a server- side web archiving option.\nReproZip-Web is an open source, grant-funded [1] web-archiving tool that can address this need. It builds on the high-fidelity crawling tools of Webrecorder by also encapsulating a dynamic web server software and its dependencies. The output is a self-contained, isolated, and preservation-ready bundle, an .rpz file, with all the information needed to replay a website, including the source code, the computational environment (e.g., the operating system, software libraries) and the files used by the app (e.g. data, static files). Its lightweight nature makes it ideal for distribution and preservation.\nThis interactive workshop will be particularly useful for web archivists, digital archivists, digital humanities scholars and others seeking to archive and preserve\ncomplex web projects. Attendees, who should be familiar with the command line interface, will practice packing and tracing a web application and recording the front-end of the site using ReproZip-Web.

{"title": ["ESTABLISHING AN OPEN-SOURCE PACKAGE \u201cARCHIVE\""], "date": ["2023", "2023-11-01T16:03:21-05:00"], "type": ["text"], "subject": ["emulation", "software preservation", "open-source"], "creator": ["Cochrane, Euan", "Gieschke, Rafael"], "description": ["Many Linux-based operating systems use a package management system that enables users to install a wide range of applications using one or more simple workflows, without needing to find and download the applications from their original publishers. The package management systems also resolve dependencies for users by finding and installing any dependent-applications or \u201cpackages\u201d that are needed in order to run the application that the user is trying to install.  These workflows greatly improve the experience of working with the operating systems and save a great deal of time for the end-users. When setting up the Emulation as a Service Infrastructure (EaaSI) platform to work with Linux-based operating systems we have encountered a number of issues when working with the operating systems\u2019 built-in Package Management Systems (PKMS). The PKMSs usually include a list of servers that host the packages that the PKMS can install for the user. We have found that often those lists are out-of-date and point to servers that no longer exist. In some cases, it is impossible or nearly impossible to find alternative servers that are still actively serving the packages, and where they are available the speed/bandwidth is often much slower/limited for packages for older operating system versions than it was when the operating systems were current. Even when an alternative server can be found that is still actively serving the packages for a legacy operating system, the average end-user can often struggle to understand how to point the PKMS at a custom server as this often requires editing relatively obscure configuration files within the Operating System. \nTo address these issues the EaaSI program of work and Yale University Library have launched a spin-off project to create a central \u201carchive\u201d  of compiled, open-source software packages. The \u201carchive\u201d will host copies of packages for many versions of legacy operating systems and make them freely available to any users, whether working with EaaSI or using the legacy operating systems in other contexts. The archive is hosted directly on a public S3-compatible bucket without an additional frontend server to improve availability, reduce maintainability, allow for practically limitless scaling, and enable users to easily explore and clone its contents (or parts thereof). In addition, the EaaSI software is being updated to enable instance administrators to configure the platform to automatically re-route connections being made to the package servers configured as defaults in legacy Linux-based operating systems and dynamically and seamlessly re-map the connections to the appropriate locations in the new package \u201carchive\u201d. This is achieved either by automatically manipulating the DKMS\u2019s configuration files or by transparently routing network requests to the originally configured domain to an emulated version of the DKMS\u2019s server in a virtual network running in EaaSI.\nUnlike Software Heritage [1], the world\u2019s preeminent archive of software source code, this project aims to primarily maintain an archive of compiled binaries and not the application source code. While there are some operating systems that use a PKMS that dynamically compiles from source code when installing applications, these are rare  and we are comfortable with the possibility of overlapping with the work of the software heritage team in this limited area. \nThere is a wide scope of future work for this project. In spite of being comfortable mildly overlapping on the work of the Software Heritage team, we are also interested in potentially creating reproducible builds of the packages in our \u201carchive\u201d within the EaaSI platform, using source code Sourced from Software Heritage. Doing the compilation from source within the EaaSI platform would provide an audit trail to further strengthen the trustworthiness of the packages provided in our \u201carchive\u201d.\nAnother future extension will be enabling sourcing packages from multiple sources, so that users can use one URL for any version of the same operating system, even if the packages were originally collected from different origin servers by our project. Here, a useful addition could be to seamlessly provide provenance information in S3 for individual packages, i.e., individual files in a directory sourced from multiple different origins.\nIn the regular use and development of repositories used by PKMSs the specific versions of the packages supplied by the repository are regularly updated and changed. IT is conceivable that users of our archive would need access to a specific version of a package, something that might not be possible if we only included the last version made available in the original repository. Therefore, a further (but much more elaborate) future extension could be to include different versions of the same package, a service offered for Debian at https://snapshot.debian.org/.\nFurther developments could include archiving the repositories of other package managers used in non-operating system contexts, e.g., PKMSs used for acquiring libraries for programming languages, for example., the Python Package Index (PyPI), Node.js\u2019 npm, or various Docker registries (e.g., DockerHub, GitHub Container Registry). Here, a particular focus could be on providing time-travel functionality (as offered by snapshot.debian.org) as software projects often do not fully specify their required library versions (e.g., by only specifying a minimum version instead of an exact version) and do not work anymore when newer versions of their required libraries become available at a later time and are selected by the package manager. Here, a bigger focus would probably be on the integration into the system than on duplicating the archive.\n\nIn this poster, we will provide a visual overview of the plans outlined in this extended abstract and hope to use it to raise awareness of the \u201carchive\u201d in order to ensure extensive use of it once it is available."], "language": ["en"], "relation": ["iPRES 2023"], "rights": ["Copyright held by the author(s).

Because of this, they might need to resort to campaigning for decision-making authority. Why is this? Memory institutions are used to adhering to standards and rules. Rules and regulations are beneficial for stability and trustworthiness. But too much focus on rules may create organizational rigidity which negatively impacts adaptability. Adaptability is a major goal for preservation so how could we create more room for this? An important part of adaptability is organizational learning. In order to facilitate learning we must understand which aspects of organizational practice negatively affect it. For example, avoiding discussion of mistakes is an important barrier to learning. If an organization prioritizes learning this can have a positive impact on the motivation of employees. Practitioners may feel more in control when they understand how to use theories of organizational learning to further implementation of preservation principles. More room for learning within the organization might also benefit the field of preservation itself through enhanced knowledge of what works and what doesn't."], "language": ["en"], "relation": ["iPRES 2023"], "rights": ["Copyright held by the author(s).

These techniques also contribute to the preservation of the trustworthiness of the records. In order to assess the situation of organizations in the implementation of their digital preservation activities, there is a need for an analysis tool. Many models have been prepared to meet this need. One is the Levels of Preservation (LoP) developed by the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA). The LoP provides guidance to organizations in their digital preservation activities. Therefore, it is thought that the LoP can be associated with trustworthiness which aims at long-term preservation of the records. This study examines the levels of digital preservation specified in the LoP in terms of the trustworthiness of digital records. As a result of this research, the goal is to provide the basis for a methodology for organizations wishing to assess their level of digital preservation and to align their digital preservation capabilities with trustworthiness. This study used document analysis as a qualitative research design. Both field observations and research show that organizations are not sufficiently aware of the level of digital preservation and trustworthiness. Then, the question of the study is \u201chow the levels that are specified in the LoP can be associated with the trustworthiness\u201d. As a result of the study, it has been observed that the levels of digital preservation specified in the LoP can be used in the analysis of the trustworthiness of the records.

In 2013, it carried out a proof of concept on email archiving, at a time when few archive services in France had embarked on the acquisition of this type of document. Ten years later, the French landscape in terms of digital recordkeeping has changed significantly. In practice, some archives have put in place strategies for archiving email and tools have been made available to assist in their effort.

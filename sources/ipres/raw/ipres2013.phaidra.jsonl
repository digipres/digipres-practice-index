We look at the combination of encoder/decoder pairs and find that using OpenJPEG for both gives the best quality results, albeit with the slowest execution time. We also find that in some circumstances, particularly when a JasPer encoder is used, in order to retain image quality of the decoded image, the best choice of decoder may not be the same codec used to create the JPEG2000; based on these results, the encoding library is therefore recommended technical preservation metadata to retain."], "dc_description_eng": ["Despite the importance of web archives for the access to historical information published on the Internet, human interaction with web archives systems has not been thoroughly addressed.

To ensure that the details of all embedded files are also recorded, nested archives are recursively unpacked and their contents characterized to identify all files in a package. Information about the embedded files is then stored as properties of the container object: this allows us to efficiently aggregate information about the contents of a container as queryable properties of the container.\nThis storage of the embedded file type information on the container object reduces the number of objects and properties which have to be queried to perform a preservation action, such as migration to a more recent file type. The database can be queried for a specific file type, and all files of that type, and archives containing files of that type will be returned without needing to query each embedded object individually.\nArchives containing files in need of preservation are temporarily unpacked and the files in need of transformation identified and migrated. Following the preservation action, the internal links within the archive are updated to maintain the integrity of the archive and the modified objects are re-ingested back into the system.\nThis approach results in minimal extra overhead at the ingest stage of preservation, but substantially reduces the number of entities which need to be queried to identify objects at risk when\nperforming preservation actions. In the case of large web archives, this may be several orders of magnitude, producing a corresponding increase in performance and scalability."], "dc_format": ["application/pdf"], "dc_identifier": ["hdl:11353/10.378060", "https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378060"], "dc_language": ["eng"], "dc_rights": ["CC BY-SA 2.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/at/"], "dc_license": ["CC BY-SA 2.0 AT", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/at/"], "dc_subject_eng": ["Scalability, Web Archiving, Characterization, iPRES, Lisbon", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2013 (001008)"], "keyword_suggest": ["Scalability, Web Archiving, Characterization, iPRES, Lisbon", "Conferences -- iPRES Conference (001000) -- Conference 2013 (001008)"], "dc_title": ["Studies on the scalability of web preservation: Paper - iPres 2013 - Lisbon"], "dc_title_eng": ["Studies on the scalability of web preservation: Paper - iPres 2013 - Lisbon"], "dc_type_eng": ["Text"], "modified": "2017-03-01T15:05:34.037Z", "owner": "joaoc48", "pid": "o:378060", "resourcetype": "text", "size": 447142.0, "title_suggest": ["Studies on the scalability of web preservation: Paper - iPres 2013 - Lisbon", "Studies on the scalability of web preservation: Paper - iPres 2013 - Lisbon"], "uwm_roles_json": ["[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Rory\",\"lastname\":\"Blevins\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"1\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Ismail\",\"lastname\":\"Patel\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"2\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Jack\",\"lastname\":\"O'Sullivan\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"3\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Ashley \",\"lastname\":\"Hunter\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"4\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Robert\",\"lastname\":\"Sharpe\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"},{\"data_order\":\"5\",\"entities\":[{\"data_order\":\"0\",\"firstname\":\"Pauline\",\"lastname\":\"Sinclair\"}],\"role\":\"aut\"}]"], "language": "", "tcreated": ["2015-01-19T16:44:40.179Z"], "_version_": 1761121352904867840, "ispartof": ["o:168770", "o:378098", "o:424738"], "sort_eng_dc_title": "Studies on the scalability of web preservation: Paper - iPres 2013 - Lisbon", "sort_dc_title": "Studies on the scalability of web preservation: Paper - iPres 2013 - Lisbon", "tsize": [447142.0], "tmodified": ["2017-03-01T15:05:34.037Z"], "__source_col_id": "o:378098", "__source_name": "iPRES", "__year": 2013}
